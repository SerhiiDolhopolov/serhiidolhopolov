## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Serhii and I'm a beginner Data engineer

## About me

### **Why I start programming**
I started my programming journey at around 12 years old. Once, I was digging through the [Block Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/270110/Block_Story/?l=russian) game files and noticed files with hero characteristics and worlds. They were simple [.json](https://www.json.org/) files. I started changing these files to get unique items and characteristics, and eventually became an admin in a large game public group, where I organized various competitions.

### **[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/) hobby**
This inspired me to start learning programming as a hobby. At first, I tried to learn basic [Java](https://www.java.com/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML), but I enjoyed [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/) much more.  
I wanted to develop games. I made several games such as fifteen, modified fool, monopoly, an auto-solver for minesweeper, an economic Telegram game, and also tried to make a turn-based strategy in Unity.

### **[JASS](https://wc3we.fandom.com/wiki/Jass_Coding) hobby**
I also started developing [Warcraft III](https://warcraft3.blizzard.com/ru-ru/) maps like [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/ru-ru/) using the scripting language [JASS].

### **C# Commercial**
#### **At university**
Later, I earned money by developing automatic calculators for university assignments.

#### **1 year experience with automation via [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)**
I worked for one year automating communication with visitors to a sales site for the purpose of advertising a certain product. The interlocutor had to be convinced that my bot was a real buyer according to a communication template and by generating a unique image for the user. For the implementation, I used standard page parsing, [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), a custom library for creating images, as well as a Telegram bot for control.

### **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**
#### **Start and commercial**
In November 2024, I started learning [Python](https://www.python.org/). In a month, I commercially developed a CRM Telegram bot with auto-analytics for a small business focused on phone repair and resale.


#### **[BigDataLab](https://www.bigdatalab.com.ua/)**
In February 2025, I started taking the course [BigDataLab from Vodafone](https://www.bigdatalab.com.ua/), so I want to work with data and become a Data Engineer.

### Epilogue
So how you can notice, I really enjoy make games as a hobbie and process automation.
