## About me

### How I Started Programming
I started my programming journey at age 12. While exploring the [Block Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/270110/Block_Story/?l=russian) game files, I discovered [.json](https://www.json.org/) files containing hero characteristics and world data. I began modifying these files to create unique items and characteristics. This led me to become an admin in a large public game community, where I organized various competitions.

### [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/) hobby
This inspired me to start learning programming as a hobby. At first, I learned the basics of [Java](https://www.java.com/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML), but I enjoyed [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/) much more.  
I wanted to develop games and created several, including Fifteen, a modified version of Fool, Monopoly, an auto-solver for Minesweeper, and an economic game for Telegram, locally turn based multiplayer game on [Unity](https://unity.com/ru).

---

### [JASS](https://wc3we.fandom.com/wiki/Jass_Coding) hobby
I also developed [Warcraft III](https://warcraft3.blizzard.com/ru-ru/) maps inspired by games like [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/ru-ru/), using the [JASS](https://wc3we.fandom.com/wiki/Jass_Coding) scripting language.

### C# Commercial
#### At university
Later, I earned money by developing automatic calculators for university assignments.

#### 1 year experience with automation via [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
For one year, I automated communication with visitors to a sales website to promote a product. The bot was designed to convince visitors it was a real buyer, using a communication template and generating unique images for each user. I implemented this using standard page parsing, [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), a custom image-creation library, and a Telegram bot for control.

---

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)
#### Start and commercial
In November 2024, I started learning [Python](https://www.python.org/). In a month, I commercially developed a CRM Telegram bot with auto-analytics for a small business focused on phone repair and resale.


#### [BigDataLab](https://www.bigdatalab.com.ua/)
In February 2025, I started taking the course [BigDataLab from Vodafone](https://www.bigdatalab.com.ua/), so I want to work with data and become a Data Engineer.

### Epilogue
As you can see, Iâ€™m passionate about making games as a hobby and automating processes.

## My hobbies:
- Sometimes I build maps for Warcraft III using the functional programming language [JASS](https://wc3we.fandom.com/wiki/Jass_Coding). <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JASS-1B2838?style=flat-square&logo=warcraft&logoColor=white" alt="Warcraft III" width="26" style="vertical-align:middle;"/>
